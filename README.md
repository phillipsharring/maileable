## About Maileable

Maileable is a library for adding filters to Laravel Mailable messages that can modify the Mailable or Swift_Message objects before they are sent.

The name "Maileable" is a play on "malleable," which, among other things, means "easily influenced; pliable." The goal of this library is to make changing messages before they are sent easy.
