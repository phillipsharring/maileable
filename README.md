## About Maileable

Maileable is a library for adding filters to Laravel Mailable messages that can you modify Mailable or Swift_Message objects before they are sent.

The name "Maileable" is a play on "malleable," which, among other things, means "easily influenced; pliable." The goal of this library is to make changing messages before they are sent easy.

## Why

## How

### Installation

### Use

### Generator

There will be a generator soon.

The only crummy part is you have to extend Maileable's Mailable class instead of Laravel's. It's basically a wrapper so that we can hook in the filters.
